## Installation
To install this application, follow the following steps:

2. Remove extra create-react-app code
3. Allow user input or randomization for depth level and max number children
4. Draw lines between parents and children
5. Utilize Redux
6. Visual design improvements
7. Limit width of children
8. Explore how ES6 destructuring could simplify code
9. Add unit tests
10. Add Faker data or allow user input of data
